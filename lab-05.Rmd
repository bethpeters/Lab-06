### Load packages

```{r load-packages, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```


# Questioning data visualisations

## Image 1

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/Speaking-the-world.jpg")
```

The bars are not to scale and the units are inconsistent. The image does not respect the mathematics because the imprecise scale of the bars makes it hard to understand the relationship between the data points for each language.




## Image 2

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rose-pop-density-total-area-bw.jpg")
```

The visualization does not respect the data because there is no legend, which makes it difficult to interpret. There is no unit of measurement which makes the interpretation even more unclear. 



## Image 3

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/life-expectancy-rule-of-law.png")
```

The data does not respect people because the data points is clumped together, which makes it hard for people to interpret. The visualization also does not respect the data because there is no unit of measurement and the x-axis is unclear (e.g. how it is continuous).




## Image 4

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/global-income-dist.PNG")
```

The data does not respect people because it would be difficult for color-blind to interpret. The use of red and green for China and Latin America respectively could be offensive.




# Exercises

```{r load-data-staff, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
staff <- read_csv("data/instructional-staff.csv")
```


## Exercise 1

What is the difference between *wide format* data and *long format* data?
Wide format has more columns and long format has more rows.


Is the format `staff` data *wide* or *long*?
Wide

How many observations are there in the data set?
5 observations



## Exercise 2

```{r pivoting}
## Uncomment and complete the following code
staff_long <- staff %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = "1975":"2011", 
    names_to = "year",
    values_to = "percent"
    )
view(staff_long)
```


## Exercise 3

```{r dot-plot}
ggplot(data = staff_long,
       mapping = aes(x = year, 
                     y = percent, 
                     colour = faculty_type)) +
  geom_point()



```
